The eTWOW GT scooter vastly exceeded my expectations and is, from what I can tell, the best city / commuting scooter out there at any price.

I've put way too many hours into the [Xiaomi m365 Scooter](/Xiaomi-m365) (aka the Mi) and have owned multiple over the past years ever since I tried one retrofitted for Bird rentals. As I stated in my rundown of the Xiaomi Mi Scooter, it's my pick for best commuter scooter... until now.

## Selection Criteria
In late January 2020 I started doing research on the latest and greatest electric scooters out there and began my quest to find something better than the trusty Mi Scooter.

### Weight
After injuring my arm lifting the $1,000 Mercane WideWheel scooter (50 lbs!!!), I set out to build a new critera for scooters moving forward, with weight being one of the important factors for my needs. As someone who rides once or twice a day and needs to lift the scooter up two separate small steps, I set a new weight cap of "under 30lb". The Mi scooter is 27.5lb so I figured just over that would be my new top end.

> The eTWOW-GT is surprisingly hard to find in the US. At the time of writing, [eWheels.com](https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-e-twow-gt-700w-504wh-25mph/) has them in stock!

An unusual property of ice frozen at atmospheric pressure is that the solid is approximately 8.3% less dense than liquid water. The density of ice is 0.9167 g/cm3 at 0 °C,[4] whereas water has a density of 0.9998 g/cm³ at the same temperature. Liquid water is densest, essentially 1.00 g/cm³, at 4 °C and becomes less dense as the water molecules begin to form the hexagonal crystals[5] of ice as the freezing point is reached. This is due to hydrogen bonding dominating the intermolecular forces, which results in a packing of molecules less compact in the solid. Density of ice increases slightly with decreasing temperature and has a value of 0.9340 g/cm³ at −180 °C (93 K).[6]

When water freezes, it increases in volume (about 9% for freshwater).[7] The effect of expansion during freezing can be dramatic, and ice expansion is a basic cause of freeze-thaw weathering of rock in nature and damage to building foundations and roadways from frost heaving. It is also a common cause of the flooding of houses when water pipes burst due to the pressure of expanding water when it freezes.

The result of this process is that ice *(in its most common form)* floats on liquid water, which is an important feature in Earth's biosphere. It has been argued that without this property, natural bodies of water would freeze, in some cases permanently, from the bottom up,[8] resulting in a loss of bottom-dependent animal and plant life in fresh and sea water. Sufficiently thin ice sheets allow light to pass through while protecting the underside from short-term weather extremes such as wind chill. This creates a sheltered environment for bacterial and algal colonies. When sea water freezes, the ice is riddled with brine-filled channels which sustain sympagic organisms such as bacteria, algae, copepods and annelids, which in turn provide food for animals such as krill and specialised fish like the bald notothen, fed upon in turn by larger animals such as emperor penguins and minke whales.

When ice melts, it absorbs as much energy as it would take to heat an equivalent mass of water by 80 °C. During the melting process, the temperature remains constant at 0 °C. While melting, any energy added breaks the hydrogen bonds between ice (water) molecules. Energy becomes available to increase the thermal energy (temperature) only after enough hydrogen bonds are broken that the ice can be considered liquid water. The amount of energy consumed in breaking hydrogen bonds in the transition from ice to water is known as the heat of fusion.

As with water, ice absorbs light at the red end of the spectrum preferentially as the result of an overtone of an oxygen-hydrogen (O-H) bond stretch. Compared with water, this absorption is shifted toward slightly lower energies. Thus, ice appears blue, with a slightly greener tint than for liquid water. Since absorption is cumulative, the color effect intensifies with increasing thickness or if internal reflections cause the light to take a longer path through the ice.
