The eTWOW GT scooter vastly exceeded my expectations and is, from what I can tell, the best city / commuting scooter out there at any price.

I've put way too many hours into the [Xiaomi m365 Scooter](/Xiaomi-m365) (aka the Mi) and have owned multiple over the past years ever since I tried one retrofitted for Bird rentals. As I stated in my rundown of the Xiaomi Mi Scooter, it's my pick for best commuter scooter... until now.

## Selection Criteria
In late January 2020 I started doing research on the latest and greatest electric scooters out there and began my quest to find something better than the trusty Mi Scooter.

### Weight
After injuring my arm lifting the $1,000 Mercane WideWheel scooter (50 lbs!!!), I set out to build a new critera for scooters moving forward, with weight being one of the important factors for my needs. As someone who rides once or twice a day and needs to lift the scooter up two separate small steps, I set a new weight cap of "under 30lb". The m365 scooter is 27.5lb so I figured just over that would be my new top end. The eTWOW GT weighs in at 26lbs, which is a miracle of science since it's twice as powerful as the m365 and has over twice the range on the battery!

### Speed / Power
TODO
This thing is absurdly fast. It regularly hits between 25mph
speedomoeter
700w engine
23mi (at 18mph)

### Tires / Ride Comfort
Generally I like to stick to pneumatic tires. I've ridden too many solid tire scooters on bumpy roads and felt like my teeth were going to chatter out of my head. Honestly I've felt like my arms were losing sensitivity from all the vibrations on some electric scooters. The eTWOW GT has dual suspension shocks which have done a surprisingly good job of smoothly easing over bumps. I'd say its about 90% as comfortable as a large pneumatic tire like the 8.5" tube tires on the m365, which is fantastic because that means I can never get a flat tire. This is a huge deal from a reliability standpoint.

> The eTWOW-GT is surprisingly hard to find in the US. At the time of writing, [eWheels.com](https://www.ewheels.com/product/new-e-twow-gt-700w-504wh-25mph/) has them in stock!
